# Japanese Text Layout task force (jlreq)

This group allows a network of experts to share information about gaps and requirements for support of Japanese on the Web and in eBooks. 

A significant problem faced by the Web is that experts don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script or language, and the W3C doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise. This network of experts should help to significantly reduce that problem. 

Some experts go a step further, and contribute to a the gap-analysis or requirements document, or to other documents produced by the group.

Topics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis document](https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/gap-analysis/). This work supports the development of the [language matrix](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which indicates hot-spots for language support. The focus is especially on typographic features for which information in English is hard to find, such as justification, letter-spacing, vertical text, text decoration, page layout, emphasis, etc.   We want to ensure that we have captured local user needs in CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing, and the many other specifications that the W3C produces.

### Following
Rather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about activity in this repository, but also about any activity for other W3C Working Group issues related to Japanese, Chinese and Korean. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback. The main purpose of the public-i18n-cjk mailing list is for notifications; meeting minutes are also sent to that list).

You can find a list of open issues, including those from Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=jlreq) page. (That link applies a `japanese` filter.)

### Contributing
All contributors must read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/jlreq/issues) to to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents. (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)

**You may raise issues in Japanese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Japanese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**

Group _members_ are expert contributors participate actively in producing the work of the group, contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in any meetings. For more information about becoming a group member contact [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org) or [木田泰夫 (Yasuo Kida)](mailto:kida@me.com). We welcome participation requests.
